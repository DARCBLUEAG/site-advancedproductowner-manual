Das Inception Deck schließt eine Lücke zwischen der strategischen Entscheidung über Produktvision und Business Model und dem Start der operativen Projektarbeit. 
Es ist ein taktisches Tool, mit dem du die Erwartungen deiner Stakeholder managen kannst.

## Ziel

Alignment is about making sure you and everyone else are on the same page with regard to why we are here, what we’re trying to do, and how are we going to get there. Basic stuff.

Expectation setting, on the other hand is about you communicating clearly with your team and stakeholders what it is going to take to make this project a success. You are defining the rules of engagement.
You need to have that conversation early and make sure your customers know what you’ll need to best serve them.

## Geschichte
The ThoughtWorks inception was primarily developed by Luke Barrett around 2004. Jonathan Rasmusson (author of The Agile Samurai) and Jeff Patton (author of User Story Mapping) both worked at ThoughtWorks for a while, and they described and further developed inception techniques in their books, from which I learned a lot.

Entwickelt von Thoughtworks und promoted durch Jonathan Rasmusson.
